First Flutter project - Basic UI.

## Getting Started

# 📝 Task Manager App (Flutter)

Welcome to this simple and easy **Task Manager App** made using **Flutter**!

This app helps users manage their daily tasks. You can **add**, **mark as complete**, and **delete** tasks. The best part? Your tasks are **saved permanently** using local storage, so they don’t disappear when you close the app!

---

## 🚀 Purpose of the App

This app is built for **beginners** who want to learn Flutter by building a real, useful app. It covers:
- Creating user interfaces using widgets
- Handling form input and validation
- Navigating between screens
- Saving and loading data using `SharedPreferences`
- Managing state with `setState()`

It's a perfect first project to understand the basics of app development with Flutter.

## 💡 What the App Includes

- A **Login screen** with email and password validation
- A **Task screen** where users can:
    - Add a new task
    - View a list of tasks
    - Mark tasks as complete ✅
    - Delete tasks 🗑️
- All tasks are saved using **SharedPreferences**, so they remain even after the app is closed

## 🔐 Login Info

You can use any valid email like:

And any password (e.g. `123456`) – no real login backend, just validation for correct format.
