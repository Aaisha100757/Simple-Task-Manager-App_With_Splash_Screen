🚀 Splash Screen Enhanced Version
In this version of the Simple Task Manager App, I’ve added something special — a splash screen that greets you every single time you launch the app!

🌟 What is a Splash Screen?
Imagine opening an app and instead of jumping straight into the main screen, you're welcomed with a smooth animation, a nice logo, and a loading spinner. That’s the splash screen — your app’s way of saying,
“Hi there! I’m loading up for you.”

🧠 Why Splash Screen?
Just like a good movie starts with a title scene, apps should open with something elegant too!
A splash screen:

🎨 Makes your app feel more professional and polished.

⏳ Gives users visual feedback that the app is loading.

💼 Creates brand recognition with logos/colors.

💡 What Changed?
🔹 You can visit my original repo here:
Simple-Task-Manager-App – This version opens directly to the login screen.

🔹 In this enhanced version, I added:

✨ A beautiful splash screen with:

A glowing app logo

A smooth loading spinner

Bright and welcoming text

🔄 A smooth transition into the login screen after a few seconds

Now the app feels alive every time you open it!
